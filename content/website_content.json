    "content": "WSL Setup\n\n# Windows Linux Subsystem Setup\n\nThis guide will take you through the steps to set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows 10 or higher. This eliminates the need for a separate virtual machine or dual-boot setup.\n\n## Step 0. Check if Virtualization is Enabled[](#step-0-check-if-virtualization-is-enabled)\n\nBefore you can run a Linux environment on Windows, you need to have virtualization enabled. To check this:\n\n1.  Open your Task Manager.\n2.  Click on the CPU tab.\n\nIf virtualization is enabled, you can proceed to Step 1. If not, you may need to enable it in your BIOS. This process depends on your CPU and motherboard. For example, if you have an AMD CPU and an MSI motherboard, here is a guide: [MSI Virtualization Guide (opens in a new tab)](https://www.msi.com/faq/nb-1627).\n\n## Step 1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux[](#step-1-install-windows-subsystem-for-linux)\n\n1.  In the Windows search bar, look up **\"Turn Windows features on or off\"**.\n2.  Scroll down until you find **\"Windows Subsystem for Linux\"**.\n3.  Check the box next to it and click OK. Your system will install or enable WSL and then restart.\n\n**Note:** If you encounter an error indicating that virtualization is not enabled for your machine, you may need to manually enable it in your BIOS.\n\n## Step 2. Install a Linux Distribution[](#step-2-install-a-linux-distribution)\n\n1.  Go to the Microsoft Store and search for **Ubuntu on Windows**.\n2.  Click **Get** or **Install**.\n\nYour computer may restart. Once done, you'll get a prompt to set up your UNIX login credentials. Create a username and password to proceed.\n\n## Step 3. Make Sure Your Distribution is Up to Date[](#step-3-make-sure-your-distribution-is-up-to-date)\n\nRun the following commands in your Linux terminal:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n```\n\n## Step 4. Create a Kuzco Account[](#step-4-create-a-kuzco-account)\n\nSign up at [Kuzco Registration (opens in a new tab)](https://kuzco.xyz/register).\n\n## Step 5. Install Kuzco Using Its Script[](#step-5-install-kuzco-using-its-script)\n\nRun the following command in your Linux terminal:\n\n```\ncurl -fsSL https://kuzco.xyz/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nIf you encounter a curl resolve error, this is likely due to a DNS issue. Reset your DNS server to Google's public DNS server, `8.8.8.8`, by running:\n\n```\necho \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null\n```\n\n**Note:** This is a temporary fix for DNS issues. In systems using NetworkManager, the `/etc/resolv.conf` file may be automatically overwritten. If you frequently encounter DNS issues, consider configuring the DNS settings through the NetworkManager's GUI or configuration files instead of directly editing `/etc/resolv.conf`.\n\nAfter fixing any DNS issues, re-run the Kuzco installation command.\n\n## Step 6. Login and Create Your Worker[](#step-6-login-and-create-your-worker)\n\nOnce Kuzco is installed, log in with the credentials you created in Step 4. You'll be prompted to select and name a new worker, then register it. This process may take some time as it involves downloading open-source AI models required for inference calls.\n\nYou'll know the setup is complete when you see a message similar to `[Worker ######]: heartbeat`, indicating your worker is now ready to handle inference requests.\n\n**If your worker crashes or needs to be restarted, run:**\n\n```\nsudo kuzco worker start\n```\n\n[Quick Start](/quick-start \"Quick Start\")[Docker Setup](/docker \"Docker Setup\")\n\nLight\n\n---\n\nMIT 2025 © Nextra."

If you are unfamiliar with Docker, please refer to the [Docker documentation (opens in a new tab)](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). Join us on Discord if you need further assistance.\n\n### Requirements[](#requirements)\n\n*   Windows or Linux operating system\n*   Any NVIDIA GPU found in our list of [supported hardware](/hardware)\n*   Docker Desktop (Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux)\n\n### Getting Started[](#getting-started)\n\nℹ️\n\nSelect your operating system below for specific installation instructions.\n\n#### Linux Installation[](#linux-installation)\n\n1.  Download and install [Docker Engine for Linux (opens in a new tab)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) (follow the official installation guide for Ubuntu)\n2.  Install NVIDIA Driver using terminal:\n\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n```\n\nOr manually select and install a specific driver version:\n\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common\nubuntu-drivers devices\nsudo apt install nvidia-driver-XXX  # Replace XXX with the recommended version number\n```\n\nYou can check the recommended driver version for your GPU at [NVIDIA's driver download page (opens in a new tab)](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)\n\n3.  Install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit for Linux (opens in a new tab)](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)\n4.  Register a Kuzco account at [https://kuzco.xyz/register (opens in a new tab)](https://kuzco.xyz/register)\n5.  Verify your email and connect your Discord account in Settings\n6.  On the dashboard, navigate to the \"Workers\" tab on the left\n7.  Click \"Create Worker\" in the top right-hand corner\n8.  Enter a name for your worker, make sure \"Docker\" is selected, and click \"Create Worker\"\n9.  On the Worker Details page, click \"Launch Worker\" in the top right-hand corner\n10.  Open Terminal and run the Docker container with your worker ID and code:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ~/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <workerid> --code <code>\n```\n\n#### Windows Installation[](#windows-installation)\n\n1.  Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows (opens in a new tab)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\n2.  Download and install the [NVIDIA Driver (opens in a new tab)](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) for your GPU\n3.  Install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit for Windows (opens in a new tab)](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)\n4.  Register a Kuzco account at [https://kuzco.xyz/register (opens in a new tab)](https://kuzco.xyz/register)\n5.  Verify your email and connect your Discord account in Settings\n6.  On the dashboard, navigate to the \"Workers\" tab on the left\n7.  Click \"Create Worker\" in the top right-hand corner\n8.  Enter a name for your worker, make sure \"Docker\" is selected, and click \"Create Worker\"\n9.  On the Worker Details page, click \"Launch Worker\" in the top right-hand corner\n10.  Open PowerShell or Windows Terminal and run the Docker container with your worker ID and code:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ${HOME}/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <workerid> --code <code>\n```\n\nOnce your worker is started, you will see it enter the \"Initializing\" state on the dashboard. This means that your worker is preparing to accept tasks. Depending on the speed of your GPU, this process may take up to 10 minutes, but generally only takes a minute or two.\n\n### Best Practices[](#best-practices)\n\nBelow are a few best practices to help you get the most out of your Kuzco Worker and avoid common issues.\n\n#### Automatic Recovery[](#automatic-recovery)\n\nDocker natively supports restarting a container when it crashes via the `--restart=always` flag. If you would like to automatically restart your worker when it crashes, you can include this flag when you start the container.\n\nFor Linux (Terminal):\n\n```\ndocker run --restart=always --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ~/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <workerid> --code <code>\n```\n\nFor Windows (PowerShell):\n\n```\ndocker run --restart=always --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ${HOME}/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <workerid> --code <code>\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `<workerid>` and `<code>` with your actual worker id and code.\n\n#### Running Multiple Instances[](#running-multiple-instances)\n\nIf you have multiple GPUs, you can run multiple instances of your worker by starting a container for each GPU and passing the `--gpus` flag to the container.\n\nFor Linux (Terminal):\n\n```\ndocker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus \"device=0\" -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ~/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <workerid> --code <code>\n```\n\nFor Windows (PowerShell):\n\n```\ndocker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus \"device=0\" -e CACHE_DIRECTORY=/root/models -v ${HOME}/.kuzco/models:/root/models kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker --worker <workerid> --code <code>\n```\n\nYou will need to run this command for each GPU you have, updating the number in the `device=` flag to the appropriate GPU number.\n\n### Useful Commands[](#useful-commands)\n\nFor both Linux (Terminal) and Windows (PowerShell):\n\nTo list all running Docker containers:\n\n```\ndocker ps\n```\n\nTo stop all running Docker containers:\n\n```\ndocker stop $(docker ps -q)\n```\n\nTo remove all stopped containers:\n\n```\ndocker container prune\n```\n\nTo force stop and remove all containers (running and stopped):\n\n```\ndocker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)\n```\n\n### Deprecation Notice[](#deprecation-notice)\n\nAt the start of Epoch 2 (Dec 2024), we have deprecated the `kuzcoxyz/worker` image. Please use the `kuzcoxyz/amd64-ollama-nvidia-worker` image instead.\n\n[WSL Setup](/wsl-setup \"WSL Setup\")[Kuzco CLI](/kuzco-cli \"Kuzco CLI\")\n\nLight\n\n---\n\nMIT 2025 © Nextra."

It will be in some sort of \"loading\" state.\n\n![Instances](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fcreated-4090.a911c670.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOnce your instance enters the \"Running\" state, you can click on the \"Logs\" icon in the bottom right-hand corner to view the logs for your worker.\n\n![Logs](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Frunning-4090.57b67b96.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere you will see your worker downloading the AI models necessary to run Kuzco. This process can take up to 10 minutes.\n\n![Logs](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Frunning-logs.9cb393cc.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBack in the Kuzco dashboard, you should see your worker enter the \"Initializing\" state:\n\n![Initialized](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fworker-initializing.e296f2ae.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAfter a few minutes, your worker will enter the \"Running\" state:\n\n![Running](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fworker-running.1e996fbf.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Congratulations!** Your worker is now running. Click \"Next Steps\" to continue to the dashboard to see your worker in action.\n\n## Common Questions[](#common-questions)\n\n**Q: When will I start earning points?**  \nA: You will start earning points once your worker is running and starts processing jobs. Depending on current network throughput, this can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour after your worker is launched.\n\n**Q: My worker failed to start, what should I do?**  \nA: Sometimes Vast rentals fail to start. If this happens, please try to start your worker again by renting another GPU. If the problem persists, please contact our support team.\n\n**Q: How do I stop my worker?**  \nA: You can stop your worker by deleting your rented instance in Vast. This will not affect your Kuzco account -- any points you have earned will still be visible in your Kuzco dashboard.\n\n---\n\n## Need Additional Help?[](#need-additional-help)\n\n*   **Visit the Kuzco Support Channel**: Join our [Discord server (opens in a new tab)](https://discord.gg/kuzco) and open a ticket.\n*   **Check Our FAQ**: We often update our documentation with answers to common questions.\n\n[Kuzco CLI](/kuzco-cli \"Kuzco CLI\")[Discord Roles](/discord-roles \"Discord Roles\")\n\nLight\n\n---\n\nMIT 2025 © Nextra."

    "content": "Discord Roles\n\n# Kuzco Discord Roles\n\nIf you’re new to Kuzco, you might be wondering how to get those special “Worker” roles on our Discord server. Worry not! In this guide, we’ll walk you through the requirements, the process to link your Discord account, and what to do if you get stuck.\n\n---\n\n## Role Overview[](#role-overview)\n\nIn Kuzco, you can earn different Discord roles based on how many points you accumulate. Each role gives you access to exclusive perks on our server. Here are the current thresholds:\n\n*   **Bronze Worker**: 10M points\n*   **Silver Worker**: 100M points\n*   **Gold Worker**: 1B points\n\nOnce you meet the point requirement for a specific role, Kuzco will automatically assign that role to you on Discord—provided your Discord account is linked.\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Get Your Role[](#steps-to-get-your-role)\n\n### 1\\. Check Your Points[](#1-check-your-points)\n\nLog in to [the Kuzco dashboard (opens in a new tab)](https://kuzco.xyz/dashboard) to see how many points you currently have. If you haven’t reached the required amount for a role, keep on earning points until you do!\n\n### 2\\. Link Your Discord Account[](#2-link-your-discord-account)\n\n1.  Go to your [dashboard settings (opens in a new tab)](https://kuzco.xyz/dashboard/settings).\n2.  Look for the **Discord Connection** section.\n3.  Click **Connect** (or **Login**), then authorize Kuzco to access your Discord account.\n\n> **Tip:** Make sure you’re connecting the correct Discord account that you use in the Kuzco server.\n\n### 3\\. Wait for Automatic Assignment[](#3-wait-for-automatic-assignment)\n\nAfter you’ve successfully linked your Discord, **please allow up to 2 hours** for the role to be assigned automatically.\n\n*   During this period, the system syncs your new point total with Discord.\n*   You don’t need to do anything else—just relax and wait!\n\n### 4\\. Still Don’t See Your Role?[](#4-still-dont-see-your-role)\n\nIf your role hasn’t appeared after 2 hours, head over to our [Discord server (opens in a new tab)](https://discord.gg/kuzco) and open a support ticket. Our team will be happy to look into it and get you sorted out.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions[](#common-questions)\n\n**Q: I earned enough points, but I forgot to link my Discord. Will I still get the role?**  \nA: You must link your Discord account in the Kuzco dashboard first. If you earned enough points before linking, don’t worry—once your account is linked, the system will check your total points and update your role accordingly.\n\n**Q: Can I have multiple Worker roles if I surpass multiple thresholds?**  \nA: You’ll only see the highest Worker role that matches your points. For example, if you qualify for Silver, you won’t also see Bronze.\n\n---\n\n## Need Additional Help?[](#need-additional-help)\n\nIf you ever have any trouble with role assignments or point calculations, we’re here for you.\n\n*   **Visit the Kuzco Support Channel**: Join our [Discord server (opens in a new tab)](https://discord.gg/kuzco) and open a ticket.\n*   **Check Our FAQ**: We often update our documentation with answers to common questions.\n\nWe hope this guide helps you get your well-deserved role!\n\n[Vast Setup](/vast \"Vast Setup\")[Hardware](/hardware \"Hardware\")\n\nLight\n\n---\n\nMIT 2025 © Nextra."
